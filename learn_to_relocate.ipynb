    "\n",
    "**NOTA**: the execution of this notebook implies running CPU-heavy and memory-heavy simulations and grid searches, that can be **extremely time-consuming**. However, after some synthetic data is generated, the notebook will save a checkpoint that can be retrieved easily.\n",

    "## Library installing\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we will need to install some libraries.\n",
    "- [MESA](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used for agent-based modelling.\n",
    "- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) provides machine learning models and utility functions.\n",
    "- [Scikit-Optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) implements Bayesian optimization for Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai) and [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.2/) contain two implementations of gradient boosted trees.\n",
    "- [imodels](https://github.com/csinva/imodels) contains implementations of some state-of-the art explainable models, most notably [FIGS](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2022/06/30/figs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also need [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) to use the DataFrame data structure, [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) to plot some graphs."

    "## MESA-based simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a standard Schelling model with a mild-random policy, where when an agent is not happy it moves to a cell where its homophily is satisfied. The implementation can be found in `schelling/model.py` and `schelling/agent.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We run several simulations, with various combinations of parameters. In particular, we use:\n",
    "- `side`: Size of the grid. 8x8 (classical chessboard) and 20x20 (bigger, hence more complex dynamic may emerge)\n",
    "- `density`:  Density (percentage of the total cells that are populated). From 2% (grid is almost empty, hence the segregation should be faster) to 66% (two thirds of the cells are occupied).\n",
    "- `minority_pc`: Minority percentage (percentage of agents that are in the minority class):  From 1/4 (mild prevalence of the majority class) to 1/2 (equality between the two classes).\n",
    "- `homophily`: minimal fraction of the neighbors that an agent needs of its own type to be considered happy. From 1/8 (extremely tolerant) to 9/8 (extremely racist).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each parameter configuration, we store the `relocation_dataset` of each agent, updated each time an agent relocates from position `start` to position `end`, with the following features:\n",
    "- Agent-level features:\n",
    "    - `steps`: Number of steps passed in `start`.\n",
    "    - `relocations`: Number of previous relocations.\n",
    "    - `segregation`: Current value of the segregation at the moment of relocation.\n",
    "    - `segregation_min`, `segregation_max`, `segregation_avg`: Minimum, maximum and average segregation relative to the period passed in `start`.\n",
    "- Location-level features:\n",
    "    - `x`, `y`: Coordinates of the location.\n",
    "    - `density`: Number of occupied cells in the neighborhood of the location.\n",
    "    - `segregation_minority`, `segregation_majority`: Segregation of the minority/majority class in the location.`\n",
    "- Target label:\n",
    "    - `happyness_duration`: Fraction of the total number of simulation steps passed in `end` by the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain a big number of records, we run every simulation 5 times, for a maximum of 500 iterations. For reproducibility, we set the random number generator with a fixed seed."

    "We want to discretize the `happyness_duration` target variable in order to solve a classification problem. By plotting an histogram of the variable discretized with 30 bins, we can observe how the distribution is very skewed, with a happyness duration that can be either very short (less than 1%) or very long (around 100%). In practice, this can be explained by the fact that a configuration can induce in the agent basically three behaviors:\n",
    "1) The agent is often unhappy and relocates continuously.\n",
    "2) The agent is happy after few relocations and stays for the whole run.\n",

It builds balanced trees, and uses *ordered boosting* in order to prevent overfitting, using a permutation-based approach to evaluate predictions on a different subset from the one used for training. It also natively supports all kind of features instead of using transformations to reduce all feature types to continuous values.\n",

    "We ran a simulation to assess the goodness of our approach, and in the end we stated that the answer is *positive*: it is possible to speed up the convergence with a properly constructed model. However, the improvement is fairly low, and the model needs a consistent amount of time and resources in order to build it. Hence, the effective value of this improvement is in fact arguable."
